# Portfolio Hut

## Overview
We plan to build a stock portfolio performance web application. Our app will allow users to compare their portfolio (e.g. Robinhood) performance against a benchmark (e.g. SPY). This will provide individual investors with the tools to evaluate their investment strategy.

## Feature List
**Required Features**

- [ ] User Accounts

- [ ] Integrate with official or unofficial API from one of Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity

- [ ] Pull the latest Portfolio snapshot from inception

- [ ] Implement data capture from one of the different benchmarks (SPY, DJIA, NDAQ, RUT)

- [ ] Implement one of the algorithms for comparing benchmark (Standard Deviation, Beta, Sharpe Ratio)

**Nice to Have**

- Domain Name, Cloudflare

- ASGI

- Chart of historical performance

- Web Sockets for live portfolio performance
